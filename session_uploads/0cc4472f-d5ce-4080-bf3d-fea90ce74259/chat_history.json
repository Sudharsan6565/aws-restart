    "message": "This file contains information about various Amazon Web Services (AWS) products and services. Here are the key points:\n\n1. Amazon S3: It's recommended for storing large binary files like audio, video, and image. Metadata for these files can be stored in your database. S3 also provides query-in-place functionality for running analytics directly on your data. Files can range from 0 bytes to 5 TB and there is unlimited storage available. Files are stored in buckets, which are root level folders.\n\n2. Data Warehouse: A specialized type of relational database optimized for analysis and reporting of large amounts of data. It combines transactional data from disparate sources.\n\n3. Amazon Textract: It's used to automatically extract printed text, handwriting, and data from any document. It uses AI for extraction and understands context.\n\n4. Amazon SageMaker: It helps data scientists and developers to prepare, build, train, and deploy high-quality machine learning models. It supports various ML development activities.\n\n5. AWS CloudFormation: It provides a common language to describe and provision all the infrastructure resources in your cloud environment in an automated and secure manner.\n\n6. AWS Business Support and AWS Enterprise Support: They provide access to all 115 Trusted Advisor checks and recommendations.\n\nThe file also mentions that AWS CloudFormation allows you to use JSON or YAML to describe what AWS resources you want to create and configure.
